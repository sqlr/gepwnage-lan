                <p>The doors will open on Friday at 17:00h. At this point we are able to use the sleeping area and the
                    bar- and console-room to start the weekend off with a nerdy social party, free beer, dinner and
                    snacks.</p>
                <p>At 22:00h on Friday the LAN-room itself opens.</p>
                <p>Saturday at around 19:00h dinner will be served.</p>
                <p>The LAN-party will end on Sunday at 15:00h.</p>
